These applications are meant to be used as buttons in the OS X Finder. I was unsatisfied with the applescript solution as it was too slow to be useful. I wrote these applications using Objective C and [Appscript](http://appscript.sourceforge.net/objc-appscript.html), so they are really fast now.

List of current applications:

  1. Go to parent folder - Adds a button to go to the parent folder in the Finder
  1. Delete permanently - Adds a button to delete selected item(s) permanently (instead of moving to Trash)

Salient features:

  * No dock icon
  * Very fast

To install, download the .app files to some location, open that location in Finder, and drag the application to the Finder toolbar.
